### Description
This is the first project I had done using R at LUT University.The task is to make sense of the “Housing_data” dataset which contains information about different houses in a specific city. from different perspectives and to build a regression model that attempts to explain the prices of the house. From your employer you receive the dataset and the following short information about the dataset:
 - PCCR: Per capita crime rate by town
 - PRLZ: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft
 - INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
 - NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
 - AVR: Average number of rooms per dwelling
 - AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
 - DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
 - RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
 - TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
 - MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
The aim is to predict the house price in thousands of dollars using the given features/ variables. The prices of the house that are represented by the variable MEDV is our target variable and the rest of variables provide information to predict the value of a house.
